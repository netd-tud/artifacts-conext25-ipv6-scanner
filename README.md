5. Move the `addr_type*.gz` files into `./data/processed/`
5. Move the `telescope` parquet files into `./data/processed/`
6. To get a clean starting environment run `make clean` first.

Now you can reproduce the paper plots with: 

7. `make plots`

The plots are then stored under `reports/figures/`

To reproduce the paper tables you can simply run:

8. `make nbconvert-clean-execute`
