# Reproduction of paper artifacts

Requirements: 64 GB of RAM, 50 GB free disk space

Clone this repository, then: 
1. Make sure python 3.10 is installed.
2. Make a virtual environment: `make python_env`
3. Activate python env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Download required data from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16419096](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16419096)
5. Move the `telescope-t*.parquet` files into `./data/processed/`
5. Move the `addr_type*.gz` files into `./data/processed/`
6. To get a clean starting environment run `make clean` first.

Now you can reproduce the paper plots with: 

7. `make plots`

The plots are then stored under `reports/figures/`

To reproduce the paper tables you can simply run:

8. `make nbconvert-clean-execute`

## Cleaning the environment
- `make clean` to remove figures and the table.html file.
- `make clean-cache` to remove the cached pickle files for faster plot rendering
- It is necessary to run these commands when creating new dataframes from the raw files (see below)

## Creating dataframes from raw data
- You can recreate parts of the dataframes with the following commands
- `make t1-from-raw` to create the telescope T1 dataframe
- `make t2-from-raw` to create the telescope T2 dataframe
- `make t3-from-raw` to create the telescope T3 dataframe
- `make t4-from-raw` to create the telescope T4 dataframe
- Clean environment (see above)
- `make plots-new`
- `make nbconvert-clean-execute-new`

## External tools
1. We include the script to perform RDNS lookups: `tools/rdns-script.sh [input addr file] [outputfile]` (input file contains one ipv6 addr per line)
2. We include the addr6 tool with small changes from the IPv6Toolkit in `tools/ipv6toolkit.tar.gz`
